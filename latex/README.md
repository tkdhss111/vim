# Mozc settings

## 'Moze setup' tool 
Select 'kotorie' and add new entries by triple clicking for every input method  
so that Escape key works as cancelation of IME for vim Japanese editing.  
N.B. Input method must be iBus.  

Change all 'Hankaku/Zenkaku' assignments to 'Ctrl Space' to change IME.
